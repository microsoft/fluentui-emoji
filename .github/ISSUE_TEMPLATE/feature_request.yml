      label: ‚ö° API Changes
      description: Include a list of all API changes, additions, subtractions as would be required by your proposal. These APIs should be considered placeholders, so the naming is not as important as getting the concepts correct. If possible you should include some example (pseudo-)code of usage of your new API.
      placeholder: |
        ```csharp
        var button = new Button ();
        button.MakeShiny = true; // new API
        ```

        The MakeShiny API works even if the button is already visible.
