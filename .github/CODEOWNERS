# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, @global-owner1 and @global-owner2
# will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
# *   @global-owner1 @global-owner2

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.
# When someone opens a pull request that only modifies JS files, only @js-owner
# and not the global owner(s) will be requested for a review.
# *.js@js-owner

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be used to look up
# users just like we do for commit author emails.
